# UTXO_analysis

This tool aims to provide an analysis of the Bitcoin's UTXO set for each type of output.
The approach is similar to https://github.com/sr-gi/bitcoin_tools, some parts of the code have been modified or rewritten in order to be more specific for our purpose. 

This page, and the code, are currently under development
